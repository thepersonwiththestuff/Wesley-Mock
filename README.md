I am 15. I am in 10th grade. I compete in marching band and First Tech Challenge. FTC has fostered my love of programming that I've had for as long as I can remember. More recently, I have begun to teach myself simple web development through netlify and creating backends for static frontends. This is for my submission for the github education benefits as I would like to expand my knowledge of web development.
